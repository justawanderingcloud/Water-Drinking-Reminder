# check if json exists, if it doesnt, create a file for users water drinking records

# (DONE) greet the user with random fact about water

# (KINDA DONE) ask the user for name (as in log-in) (list already known users)

# if the json exists then count number of days when the user drank water
# and tell them that so far they have drank enough water for X days

# (DONE) ask for input if user has drunk enough water today

# (KINDA, not for JSON) if yes ask for volume and write yes and volume into json

# if no remind them it is important to drink enough water and write no into json

# return to input with quote that this is the next day

# (DONE) rewrite for while true loop

# allow for the user to stop the script when they fail to answer yes/no
